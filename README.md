# Fontend Mentor - Order Summary Component

My Frontend Mentor solution for the order summary component challenge. This looked a lot like something I have seen in a ton of websites so I really enjoyed practicing with something I will be seeing a lot of in the real world.

## My process:

- Desktop first Workflow
- Responsive Design
- Flexbox

## What I learned:

Got some practice with using lists to organize text on-top of each other, for some reason it took a bit for it to click for me.
